# Project Structure:

# Introduction to Clustering:

Understand the mathematical foundations of clustering and its significance in data analysis.

# Lagrangian Relaxation:

Explore the Lagrangian relaxation technique to effectively address complex constraints in clustering problems, integrating them into the objective function.


# Heuristic Formulation:

Formalize a heuristic method proposed by Cornu√©jols, implementing the Lagrangian relaxation discussed earlier. Address the inconsistencies in the model when dealing with large values of N. Establish two propositions pointing to the nature of the problem as a convex linear optimization challenge.

# Implementation and Example:

Present a practical example implementing the model from Section 2 using AMPL for a small N value. Tables and images provide clear support for interpretation, offering a concise demonstration of the developed model's functionality.
